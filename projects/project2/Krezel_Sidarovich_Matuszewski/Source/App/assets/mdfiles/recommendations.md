## Hey, let's play a game

All you have to do is pick a target for each audio feature on the left and I'll try my *very best*
to find songs that most accurately fit your picky criteria. I promise not to judge your music "taste".

Actually I lied. I'll judge your every choice. But less talking more picking. Let's start!

## Here are the top matches

In first place we've got...

**1.** **{top_1_track}** by **{top_1_track_artist}** with a *whopping* {top_1_score} points

{random_comment_1}


**2.** **{top_2_track}** by **{top_2_track_artist}** with a pathetic {top_2_score} points

{random_comment_2}


**3.** **{top_3_track}** by **{top_3_track_artist}** with a mere {top_3_score} points

{random_comment_3}


**4.** **{top_4_track}** by **{top_4_track_artist}** with a sad {top_4_score} points

{random_comment_4}

**5.** **{top_5_track}** by **{top_5_track_artist}** with only {top_5_score} points

{random_comment_5}

Sorry, but that's it! Take it or leave it...
