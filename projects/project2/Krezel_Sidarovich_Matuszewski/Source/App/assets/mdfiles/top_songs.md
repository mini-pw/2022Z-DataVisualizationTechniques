## Total streams mean nothing

Have you ever been disappointed with spotify wrapped wrongly assuming what's your favourite song?

skipped streams that lasted for less than a second.

The chart on the right represents your true **Top 150**.

Size of each bubble represents the score that each of the songs got based on our very own
*Algorithm*.

The axes do not represent all of the factors but two of the most important ones. **Consistency** and **Number Full Streams**
